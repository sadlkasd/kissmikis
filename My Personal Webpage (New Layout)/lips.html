            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
            Feeling dry today<br>
            My voice doesn't come out easily<br>
            There are so many things I haven't said in a while<br>
            I'm scared that you won't hear me well</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
            While a long, long time has passed<br>
            My heart is still heading towards you<br>
            Please tell me it's not too late<br>
            I'm out of breath and a little trembling<br>
            It’s been a while since I confess this</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
            I love you<br>
            Even if it's not perfect timing<br>
            Don’t look away and look at my mouth babe<br>
            Don't listen carefully<br>
            Just read my lips<br>
            I'll tell you very slowly</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
            While a long journey has passed<br>
            I can't express myself every day<br>
            Please tell me you feel the same way<br>
            My mouth is dry and I'm trembling more than before<br>
            It’s been a while since I confess this</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
            I love you<br>
            Even if it's not perfect timing<br>
            Don’t look away and look at my mouth babe<br>
            Don't listen carefully<br>
            Just read my lips<br>
            I'll tell you very slowly</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
            I'll tell you<br>
            We like each other at the same time<br>
            In difficult odds<br>
            I think it's all in<br>
            I'll repeat it all night long<br>
            I can't speak loudly, I'm quiet<br>
            Moisten the corners of your mouth</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
            I love you<br>
            I think it's perfect timing<br>
            Look at my serious expression and the shape of my mouth babe<br>
            Cover your ears with both hands<br>
            Just read my lips<br>
            I'll tell you very slowly</p>

            <p>As the candles flickered on the eve of my birthday, little did I know that the universe had conspired to bestow upon me a profound gift: the soul-stirring performance of "Lips" by WINTER. This serendipitous moment, where music intertwined with the magic of celebration, became an indelible mark in my heart. Join me as we embark on a heartfelt exploration of this enchanting song, a token of musical delight gifted to me by WINTER herself.</p>
            
            <p>The lyrical journey of "Lips" begins with a tender admission of vulnerability. WINTER's delicate vocals breathe life into verses laden with unspoken words and muted confessions. "Feeling dry today, my voice doesn't come out easily," she sings, echoing the sentiment of apprehension and longing that resonates deeply within. As the melody unfolds, each line becomes a poignant brushstroke painting a portrait of emotions too profound to articulate.</p>
            
            <p>At the heart of "Lips" lies the courage to bare one's soul, even amidst uncertainty and fear. The pre-chorus becomes a poignant plea for understanding, a yearning to be heard amidst the cacophony of silence. "Please tell me it's not too late," WINTER implores, her voice trembling with emotion. In these words, I found solace in the recognition that vulnerability is not weakness but rather a testament to the depth of our emotions.</p>
            
            <p>As the chorus unfolds, "Lips" transforms into a melodic declaration of love, transcending the constraints of time and circumstance. With each refrain of "I love you," WINTER's voice becomes a beacon of hope, illuminating the path towards connection and intimacy. The simplicity of the directive to "just read my lips" speaks volumes, reminding us that sometimes, words are superfluous in the language of love.</p>
            
            <p>As I reflect on the serendipitous timing of WINTER's performance, I am filled with gratitude for the gift of music that graced my birthday. "Lips" became more than just a song; it became a symphony of emotions, a testament to the power of music to elevate moments of celebration into memories etched in the fabric of our existence.</p>
            
            <p>In the tapestry of life, moments of unexpected beauty often emerge as the most precious gifts. WINTER's performance of "Lips" on the cusp of my birthday became a poignant reminder of the transformative power of music to touch our hearts and souls. As I carry the melody of "Lips" with me into the coming year, I do so with a renewed appreciation for the magic of serendipity and the timeless beauty of musical expression.</p>
